:wave: Welcome to the NXM Github Page!

<br />

By now you should have received our development kit. Right now this is based on the STM32U5 microcontroller, but more chipsets will be supported soon including high-performance processors based on Arm Cortex-A.

<br />

In this development kit, you will learn how to use the NXM Autonomous Security Platform to provide end-to-end, product lifecycle security protection for your IoT product. You will receive comprehensive insights on how to apply leading edge security practices based on Arm’s emerging Platform Security Architecture (PSA) that is being widely adopted by the IoT industry.

<br />

You will see how we use the STM32U5 Discovery Kit and NXM SDKs to build a reference IoT device based on FreeRTOS along with associated user applications.  We’ll connect these end-points into an AWS IoT Core cloud service to create a full IoT OEM platform.

<br />

You will learn how to:
1. Automate security using Zero-Touch and Zero-Trust security principles
2. Eliminate single points of failure in your IoT product and service design
3. Build-in complete threat protection without impacting the end-user
4. Design, develop and debug products that use Arm TrustZone
5. Utilize a blockchain-based public key distribution service
6. Create data segmentation based on publish/subscribe topics
7. Easily deploy end-to-end security on a per topic-basis

<br />

Please visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/NXM-Labs/nxm-ep-security/wiki) for detailed instructions and documentation on using our demo application, learning more about autonomous security and building your own application.
